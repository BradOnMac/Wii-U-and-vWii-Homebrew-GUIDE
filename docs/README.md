!> Every time you modify a device, you always have a chance to have a **UNRECOVERABLE BRICK!**, The chances of being bricked are close to none nowadays, but they are still a possibility! So make sure you follow **ALL** directions **EXACTLY**.

?> This guide will work on any Wii U on the lastest update. you just need an SD card, a device to put files onto the SD card, and a Wii U with access to the internet.

If everything goes well (and nothing goes ary), you should have everything you started with (Eshop titles, saves, etc etc.)

Keep your console plugged in at all times to prevent data loss & damage...

!> If you do unplug it, you could get bricked. Read more about bricks here:
